                    <p>Hey there! My name name is Thomas Joseph Cottis and I am currently working as a delivery driver for a
                        medical equipment distributor by day, and a web-developer freelancing by night.</p>
                    <p>I love to travel, learn new things, create things and build aesthetic things. For example, I am
                        really into art, interior design, photography, movies, music and pretty much anything else that any
                        other young person is into (besides drugs lol)</p>
                    <p>I served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Lima, Peru from 2018 to 2020. Before that I spent 3 weeks in the Dominican Republic building a small school with a service group and I absolutely loved it. I would recommend to everyone to go and see the world, but as you do to make sure that you make wherever you go a better place.</p>

                    <p>Here is a list of the top ten things that I watch out for when I know that I should get back to work instead of surfing the web</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When I have youtube, facebook and instagram all open at once</li>
                        <li>When my friend doesn't have work (on any given day that he doesn't) so he sends me reels from social media platforms</li>
                        <li>When I go down a rabbit hole about some conspiracy theory</li>
                        <li>When I watch / listen to a podcast that is far more interesting than my work</li>
                        <li>When I am researching something really quick, but then I see a pop-up add for something that I was searching before and I inevitably click on (because the internet is always listening)</li>
                        <li>When I am am playing a video-game and can't go to bed unless I win at least one match (but I'm not very good, so)</li>
                        <li>When I absolutely have to double check where my Amazon package is, even though it wouldn't make any difference on when it actually gets here</li>
                        <li>When I can't find the perfect song to work to so I end up on youtube for the next half hour (it happens to all of us)</li>
                        <li>When I get hungry so I google recipes</li>
                        <li>When I get a random idea to build something that would actually be really cool, so I have to write it down, then inevitably start researching</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Here is a list of the top ten things that I love to do, whether alone or with someone</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I love to rock climb. I love it because it gets me outdoors, but it also gets my blood pumping with adrenaline (in a relatively safe way</li>
                        <li>I love to run. Running has been the main way that I get outside and exercising</li>
                        <li>Travel. For me, travelling is a love hate relationship. It definitely depends on how long I stay and where I go, but I generally love it</li>
                        <li>Photography, which goes along with travel. I love to take and edit pictures because through it, I can show off the earth and life in general. It makes be grateful to be here</li>
                        <li>Being with my loved ones. I mean, who doesn't like to be around those who they love and trust</li>
                        <li>Eating is something that has grown on me once I started travelling more regularly. Food is just so good!</li>
                        <li>Watching movies is something that me and my wife have loved since we've been together. Nothing is better than curling up together with a good movie</li>
                        <li>I love to design and build furniture. It is something that I have been doing for a couple years now and absolutely love it</li>
                        <li>I like to cook, but only for myself and when I'm hungry</li>
                        <li>I love to improve my Spanish. Especially my accent, because the American accent in Spanish is definitely not desirable</li>
                    </ol>
