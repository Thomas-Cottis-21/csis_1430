                <p>My name is Thomas Cottis and I have a profound passion for creating beautiful things. I don't know what it really is, but when I see something amazing, whether it's a really well put website or an apartment complex that is clean, spacious, modern and with a great view, I feel inspired to be a better person and to keep on trying to create, although it can be terribly difficult. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved to be at home because it was always clean (thanks to mom) and it was always so good looking. I loved coming home after a long day, to a home that was golden with sunlight, or cozy in a rainstorm.</p>
                <p>Even though I love being home, I also love to be outside, exploring, camping, adventuring, rock climbing, hiking, swimming or really anything else. I think getting outside is great excercise as well, which leads to a happier life. Here are 5 reasons why being outdoors is one of my many hobbies.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fresh air and sunlight: Being outside provides an opportunity to breathe in fresh air, which can help to improve lung function and overall health. Sunlight exposure is also important for the body to produce vitamin D, which helps to support healthy bones and the immune system.</li>
                    <li>Exercise: Outdoor activities, such as walking, hiking, biking, and swimming, provide an opportunity to engage in physical activity and get some exercise. Regular exercise has been linked to improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.</li>
                    <li>Stress reduction: Spending time in nature has been shown to reduce stress and promote relaxation. This is partly because being outside can help to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the body.</li>
                    <li>Improved mood: Being outside can boost mood and improve mental health. This is partly due to the benefits of exposure to natural light, which has been shown to improve mood and help with symptoms of depression.</li>
                    <li>Connection to nature: Being outside provides an opportunity to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the natural world. This can help to foster a sense of gratitude and a greater understanding of our place in the world.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Another hobby of mine is photography. Photography is often considered beautiful because it has the ability to capture and convey emotions, memories, and stories through visual images. It can capture fleeting moments, unique perspectives, and remarkable details in a way that is not possible through other mediums.

                    Photography is also beautiful because it can be used to showcase the beauty of the world around us. It can capture the intricate details of nature, the vibrancy of a cityscape, or the grandeur of a landscape. Photographers use composition, lighting, and color to create images that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also emotionally evocative.
                    
                    Another reason why photography is beautiful is that it can be used to convey the beauty of human experiences. It can capture the joy and wonder of childhood, the intimacy of a romantic relationship, the pride and accomplishment of a personal achievement, or the sorrow and empathy of a difficult moment.
                    
                    Ultimately, photography is beautiful because it allows us to see the world through someone else's eyes. It allows us to experience moments and emotions that we may not have otherwise had the opportunity to see or feel. Through photography, we can connect with others, appreciate the beauty around us, and gain new perspectives on the world.</p>
