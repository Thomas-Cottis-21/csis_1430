            <p>Hangman is a popular word game that has been played for centuries. The origins of the game are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Victorian England. It is said to have been played by prisoners waiting to be executed, who would create and solve word puzzles to pass the time.

                The game involves guessing a word or phrase by guessing letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman being drawn, with the goal being to guess the word or phrase before the entire hangman is completed.
                
                The game became popular as a pen-and-paper game in the early 20th century, and later in the century it was also popularized as a board game. It has since become a popular party game and educational tool, used to teach spelling and vocabulary.</p>
                
                <p>In recent years, the game has faced criticism due to its violent connotations and association with capital punishment. Some educators have replaced the traditional hangman with less controversial alternatives, such as "hang the apples" or "hang the snowman." Despite this controversy, the game remains popular and continues to be enjoyed by many.</p>
